# Horiseon Business Strategies

## Description

Here is a webpage summarising some online marketing tips, with topics such as Search Engine Optimization, Online Reputation Management and Social Media Marketing.

 My personal project on this webpage was only to go behind the scenes and tidy up some code. This has helped me to understand semantic HTML and spot some repeating code.
